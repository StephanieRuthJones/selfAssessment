#Self Assessment - Block 1

1. **What areas do you feel you are struggling the most in? (Be specific, technologies, habits, etc.)**

-Trying to code outside of class to solidify skills - Ryan and I are “accountability buddies” so this has helped
-Understanding and using POST (being able to submit forms correctly) 
-Using learned skills together - e.g., being able to use event listeners to click on an item, associate a quantity to the item (e.g., galvanize eats), then ensure it is posted accurately
-Understand ES6 and this
-Work on use of web development vocabulary




2. **Develop a plan using S.M.A.R.T. goals to continue progress in the areas you mentioned above.** *S.M.A.R.T. - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely.*
-Throughout the current block, Stephanie will complete at least one learn module per day, earning a mastery level of at least 2, on 4 out of 5 weekdays.

-By December 10th, Stephanie will be able to create at least one complete, interactive website, built using semantic HTML and bootstrap, that accurately makes GET and POST requests, uses forms and outputs(correct terminology?) that require calculations, and event listeners, given minimal assistance.

-By December 20th, Stephanie will be able to code using ES6 syntax across all JS projects.

-By December 10th, Stephanie will be able to understand and use this while coding in JS across all appropriate contexts.

-By December 10th, Stephanie will use accurate web development terminology during code reviews, while asking/answering questions, and while describing concepts, given access to google and the ability to ask questions specifying vocabulary words.


3. **Look back at Block 1, choose 3 'aha' moments where something clicked and describe them below.**
-For looping through an object to add elements/bootstrap cards to a website 
-Understanding importance of/using console to troubleshoot code
-Understanding event.target 
-Understanding nodes/possible event listeners

4. **What areas do you feel the most confident in? What is making you happy right now?**
-Made most improvement in event listeners, but need a lot more practice
-Most excited about learning to pull from databases 

5. **What technologies/industries are you most excited about currently?**

-Machine learning
-Blockchain/Ethereum - using them for the good of humanity!!
-Artificial Intelligence
    -https://thegrid.io/ 
-Augmented Reality
-Virtual Reality
